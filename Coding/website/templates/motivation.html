                    <h2>Our reason</h2><p>The often executive position of President of family business groups is inevitably a lonely one. In addition, the management of shareholder matters and, at the same time, the need to guarantee a response to the development of strategic challenges or the organization of the business with an exclusively endogamous character, is necessarily limited. For this reason, counseling by senior, experienced, sensitive and trustworthy independent personalities brings new perspectives and high added value solutions in either of the two dimensions – the management of the Family and the shareholder forum and the management of the business. Therein lies the basis of our vocation and it will always be with great rigor and enthusiasm that we will respond to the call.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Our distinctive character</h2><p>We are Advisors (or Counselors) and not Consultants. We occupy a space of our own that is totally different from the market of international consultants – despite being prepared to lead large transformation projects, ARBORIS is, essentially, the set of its Managing Partners and not a battalion of young people in different stages of their development process. learning. We are dedicated to advising and helping to resolve issues that require seniority – because what we know how to do well is to listen, challenge and ensure the best solutions for concrete and often complex problems, both shareholder and business, depending on the Chairman's needs.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Our intervention <model></model></h2><p>Our intervention model starts from the establishment of an ongoing relationship of trust, dialogue and closeness to shareholders and the business, a relationship that materializes in concrete interventions (with objectives, methodology, timetable, ...) whenever the customer feels this need. It is therefore a model that is based on a relationship of trust and continuous intimacy where discretionary collaborations fit over time, with high efficiency thanks to the always updated knowledge of the context resulting from the continuous relationship between the two parties and, in particular, between the President of the Group and the Managing Partners of ARBORIS.</p><p>The success of our work is thus determined by the close and trusting relationship between the Chairman and the Managing Partners of ARBORIS and by high standards of commitment, seniority, sensitivity and, of course, absolute discretion and confidentiality.</p>
