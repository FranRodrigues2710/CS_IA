                    <p><big>ARBORIS was born with the mission of providing fully customized and personalized advice to the President and the shareholder body of reference business groups with family roots in Portugal, specializing in frequently complex and delicate themes linked to the dynamics of this type of organization and crossing four deeply complementary areas of expertise - Strategy, Organization, Governance and People.</big></p><p><big>This initiative of ours, which in the future may see its scope expanded as professionals with similar values and levels of experience and knowledge in other areas join us, is based on three pillars:</big></p><h2>We have decades of experience with the largest Family Groups</h2><p><big>Firstly, the complementary skills of the Founding Partners, based on decades of experience serving private business groups as Consultants or Executive or Non-Executive Directors, always with recognized success.</big></p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>We represent a new and unique offer for family businesses all over Europe</h2><p><big>According to the observation that there is no offer of this nature in Europe:</big></p><ul>	<li><big>International consulting companies focus on an eminently technical approach served by teams of undeniable value but often with limited professional and life experience and with too narrow a career focus, because this is how these international companies want the profile of their employees to evolve.</big></li>	<li><big>Many family groups turn to trusted external professionals to advise them on ARBORIS' own challenges, but their intervention and the results obtained normally fall short of the needs given the overly specialized nature of these professionals in a given functional area and their lack of curriculum in challenging consultancy and of wide scope in other business groups. However, we often subcontract this type of personality to intervene in very specific points of an eminently technical nature, where they actually feel comfortable.</big></li></ul><h3><big><em>It's lonely at the top</em></big></h3><p><big>Lastly, the President and Shareholders with top executive positions have, by definition, a solitary position and therefore feel the need to be able to interact with external elements that can be seen as their peers and recognized for their competence and sensitivity, starting to have interlocutors with whom they can exchange ideas and opinions freely without fear that these conversations will leave the room and generate concern or instability in the organization.</big></p>
